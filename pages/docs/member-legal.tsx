        <h2 id='section13'>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <div className='text-section'>
          <strong>14.1</strong> In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement
          arising from or relating to the Agreements or the breach thereof, the parties hereto shall
          use their best efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question, or disagreement. To this
          effect, they shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing
          their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to
          both parties. If they do not reach such solution within a period of 60 days, then, upon
          notice by either party to the other the parties agree to try in good faith to settle the
          dispute in mediation by a mutually agreed upon mediator.
          <br />
          <strong>14.2</strong> If, after mediation, the parties have not reached a solution, then,
          upon notice by either party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions, or differences
          shall be finally settled in binding arbitration administered in accordance with the rules
          of the American Arbitration Association.
