          Referred Merchant (“Commission Fee”) that you refer to Moob under and in accordance with
          the terms of this Agreement, when the Referred Merchant becomes a Moob Business Account
          holder under the following conditions, which must all be met prior to the payment of the

          <div className='indent'>
            <strong>4.1.1.</strong> The Referred Merchant must be a new and unique merchant to Moob
            and must never have been a Moob Business Account holder at any time.

            <strong>4.1.2.</strong> You must submit the name of the Referred Merchant to Moob
            through our website. This submission process formally associates the Referred Merchant

            <br />
            <strong>4.1.3.</strong> The Referred Merchant agrees to our Terms and Conditions and

          to you that is not objected to by you within 60 days of the applicable payment date shall
          be deemed final and binding on the Parties
        </div>

            payment preferences.
          </div>
          <strong>5.3.</strong> Each affiliate is required to submit a W-9 tax form to Moob.

        </div>
        <br />

        <h2 id='section6'>6. TERM OF THE AGREEMENT</h2>
        <p>
