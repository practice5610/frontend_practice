          <h2 id='section3'>3. Responsibilities And Limitations</h2>
          By consenting to the Agreements, merchants agree:
          <div className='text-section'>
            <strong>3.1.</strong> To offer promotions to cardholders which allow cardholders to earn
            a reward amount in the form of Moob Credit.
            <div className='indent'>
              <strong>3.1.1.</strong> The merchant is responsible for adding its own content, offers
              and promotions to the Moob site. Moob is not responsible for errors made by the
              merchant in submitting or publishing their content, offers or promotions.
              <br />
              <strong>3.1.2.</strong> Offers and rewards to cardholders are determined by the
              merchant, subject to the following minimum requirements: Merchants agree that the
              minimum rewards offered are either three percent (3%) of the total cardholder
              purchase, if the merchant is using a percentage structure, or one dollar ($1.00), if
              the merchant is using a set minimum monetary amount per purchase.
              <br />
              <strong>3.1.3.</strong> Moob receives a commission on each cardholder purchase made
              through the Moob card. This amount will be determined for an individual merchant by
              the Moob software, and will vary based on the business type, category and/or location
              of the merchant.
            </div>
            <strong>3.2.</strong> That Moob may use the merchant's name, logo, photos, and
            description for marketing and advertising purposes, including, but not limited to, use
            on the website.
            <br />
            <strong>3.3.</strong> That by posting or displaying any information, content or material
            (“User Content”) on the Moob websites or providing any User Content to
            moobmarketplace.com or Moob or our representative(s), you grant an irrevocable,
            perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, and sub-licensable (through multiple tiers) license
            to Moob to display, transmit, distribute, reproduce, publish, duplicate, adapt, modify,
            translate, create derivative works, and otherwise use any or all of the User Content in
            any form, media, or technology now known or not currently known in any manner and for
            any purpose which may be beneficial to the operation of Moob, the provision of any
            Services and/or the business of the User. You confirm and warrant to Moob that you have
            all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the above license.
            <br />
            <strong>3.4.</strong> To accept the Moob card for payment by cardholders.
            <div className='indent'>
              <strong>3.4.1.</strong> In order to accept payment via Moob Credit, the merchant must
              scan the member’s card, or enter the card’s account number, into the provided merchant
              /Moob software interface to receive an approval code from Moob prior to releasing
              goods or services to a cardholder.
              <br />
              <strong>3.4.2.</strong> If the merchant scans a card and receives a decline code then
              the merchant is not to release goods to the cardholder and must ask for another form
              of payment. Moob is not responsible for the goods or services delivered if no approval
              code is given to the merchant via the Moob Merchant software interface.
            </div>
            <strong>3.5.</strong> To guarantee that offers and promotions offered on the website
            will be honored upon redemption by cardholders. Merchants expressly indemnify and hold
            Moob harmless from any and all claims or demands, including the payment of reasonable
            attorney fees, arising out of or relating to the merchants failure to honor an offer or
            promotion published on the website.
            <br />
            <strong>3.6.</strong> Not to undertake any action which may undermine the integrity of
            Moob’s customer feedback or customer reviews system, such as leaving positive feedback
            for your Business, using secondary Member IDs or through third parties or by leaving
            unsubstantiated negative feedback for another User.
            <br />
            <strong>3.7.</strong> That Moob will not credit cardholders with reward earnings until
            the earnings and Moob’s commission has been paid by the merchant. Amounts to be received
            by the cardholder will be seen in their account as “processing”. If funds are not
            received within thirty (30) days then the cardholder funds status will change from
            “processing” to “pending”. If the funds are not received within ninety (90) days then
            the member will see the funds status as “merchant default”.
            <br />
            <strong>3.8.</strong> That a merchant is defined as being in default when they fail to
            fulfill their rewards obligations to their Moob customers and Moob.
            <div className='indent'>
              <strong>3.8.1</strong> Default status will be shared with cardholders who have availed
              the merchants offer and the merchant has not provided the promoted rewards.
              <br />
              <strong>3.8.2.</strong> Moob retains the sole right to terminate a merchant who is in
              default, and being in default is reasonable grounds for terminating all agreements
              with a merchant.
            </div>
            <strong>3.9.</strong> Chargebacks and Refunds
            <div className='indent'>
              <strong>3.9.1.</strong> Any refunds or chargebacks will be subject to the merchant’s
              refund policy, and handled fully by the merchant.
              <br />
              <strong>3.9.2.</strong> Any dispute over a chargeback or refund is subject to the
              Dispute Resolution requirements contained within Paragraph 14 of these Terms and
              Conditions.

                account and purchases a minimum of $5.00 in Moob Credit; and

                <strong>3.10.1.3.</strong> The cardholder uses their Moob Card to make purchases
